Welcome to the CS50 IDE! Below are a list of features and some tips and tricks
for usage and getting started.

# Features

* Fully-featured IDE with syntax highlighting and word completion for C and
  other languages.

* An embedded terminal window, below, that provides you with command-line
  access to your very own Ubuntu instance, much like the CS50 Appliance, but
  in the cloud! (try typing `ls`!)

* File browser at left, which lets you navigate the files and folders in
  your workspace (without using `cd` and `ls`).

* A graphical interface to `gdb`! To debug a program you're working on,
  click the `Debug` button up top.
